      <p>I love to help others transform through fitness! I have worked with many clients just like you who have felt frustrated, overwhelmed, and helpless. I love working with beginners and those who have failed in the past because I was once a beginner too!</p>
      <p>I am a certified Fit to Enforce Fitness Instructor. I have held certifications from the Aerobics and Fitness Association of America, and I was a certified CrossFit Level 1 trainer for five years. I am a National Academy of Sports Medicine Certified Nutrition Counselor, and I am currently working on updating my NASM Personal Trainer certification. I am blessed to have accomplished many fitness-oriented goals including marathons, triathlons, figure competitions, and amateur boxing.</p>
